## Hardware Features

### Connectors

- **Sicma 56 Connector**: A weatherproof connector available on [AliExpress](https://aliexpress.com/item/32857771975.html).
- **Connector with 20cm Wiring Harness**: This is available for connecting to the Eidothea Board, also on [AliExpress](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005007332736311.html).

### Connectivity

- **2x CAN Bus Ports**: Available via SubD9 connectors (120Î© selectable).
- **Engine Connections**: All engine connections can be interrupted or disconnected as needed.
- **Pin Headers**: All signals are available on pin headers for easy probing or signal injection.

### Features

- **Ignition Toggle Switch**: For bench testing purposes.
- **Main Power Relay**: For controlling power during testing.
- **Analog Channel Emulation**: Analog channels can be emulated using potentiometers for simulation.
